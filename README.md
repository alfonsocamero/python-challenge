# python-challenge

There are two scripts within this repo. 

**PyBank script**
This script uses the os and cvs modules to import a file containing two columns populated with dates and profit/loss amounts for each month.

This script scans through this data to count the number of months being analyzed as well as give some insight into the profit/loss numbers. Namely, it calculates the net total profit/loss at the end of the entire period, the average change in profit/loss month-to-month, as well as the greatest increase and greatest decrease in profir/loss and their respective months.

**PyPoll script**
This cript also uses the os and csv modules. However, this file analyzes election data. This script extracts the names of the candidates and counts the number of votes casted, the amount of votes each candidate received, as well as the respective percentage those votes represent. 

Both scripts produce an output file containing an analysis of each set of data.
